# Sandbox Engine

Sandbox Engine is a real-time 3D development tool for creating interactive virtual worlds.\
The main goal of the engine is to provide an efficient and stable solution for creating virtual worlds with total real-time destruction of world environment.\
To achieve high performance in real-time destruction, the engine will be designed to use voxel technologies.
